# Lorenzo's Bank
This is a Java OOP exercise that simulates a functional bank application with multiple features. It runs in the terminal and includes a user interface with menu options for navigation and execution of operations.

The user can create a new account or log in to an existing one, with all necessary validations performed during the process. Once logged in, they are greeted and can manage their account through several available operations.

The application includes a BankAccount class with several methods, including withdrawal, deposit, and transferring between accounts, as well as checking balance, creating accounts, and more.

It also includes a DataBase class that uses an object vector to store and manage all account information, with methods to insert, delete, and locate accounts, as well as rearrange and sort the array.
