# BankAccount
This is a Java OOP exercise that simulates a functional bank account with several methods, including withdrawal, deposit, transferring between accounts, checking the balance, creating, and deleting accounts.

It also includes a database class that uses an object vector to store and manage all account information, with methods to insert, delete, and locate accounts, as well as rearrange and sort the array.
